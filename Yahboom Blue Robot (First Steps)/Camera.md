# Camera & Sonar

## Controlling Camera Servos
Included in files/servos.py is GPIO pin code to control the servos of both the camera and the sonar servos. Take a look at the code and play with it. Get the servos on the camera to move around, looking up and down, left and right


### Task 1: 
Using the movement code and servo code, write a program to take a 360 degree photo, by taking picture facing straight up, middle, then down in 10 degree increments (Note: When you hit the range of the servo, you will need to turn in place to spin and keep taking images of the area that you haven't been able to see so far)

(Hint: Open CV 2 will be your friend when trying to take images and use them)


### Controlling Sonar Servos
Try using the sonar servo code to also move the sonar around as you wish. 

### Task 2: 
Use sonar input to measure the distance to a wall, then drive up to the wall, staying at least 0.5m away. Honestly, I am not currently sure how to get the sonar input from the robot, so if you figure it out. Let me know! :) (sonorousduck on discord)
