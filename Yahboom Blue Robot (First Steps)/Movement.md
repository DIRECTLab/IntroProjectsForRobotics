# Movement (Yahboom Tank)

Provided is some code to get the Yahboom tank moving. (Check files/movement.py). This is done through GPIO pin manipulation. Take a look at the code and understand it. In the next steps (on the XR robot) we will be using ROS to control movement, which abstracts away this low level control and works much nicer. However, it is good to understand that this is possible.

## Task 1:
Using the provided code, drive in a box that is 5m x 5m large.
